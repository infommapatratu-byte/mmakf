-- Supabase Data API lockdown, third pass — for the tables added by 0019.
--
-- 0010_data_api_lockdown.sql states the rule this file obeys:
--
--     "A future migration that adds tables must be followed by a NEW lockdown
--      migration — never by editing this one."
--
-- 0019_entitlements.sql adds `entitlements` and `entitlement_terms`, and
-- `ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` can only secure tables that exist when it runs.
-- Without this file both would sit outside the lockdown with RLS off — and
-- `entitlements` names a person's membership, the order that paid for it and
-- the receipt number, which is exactly the join an attacker would most like.
--
-- tests/data-api-lockdown.test.ts is the thing that insists on it, by name:
-- "has no migration creating a table behind the lockdown".
--
-- The loop is written against the catalogue rather than a list of two names, so
-- it also secures anything an earlier migration added and forgot.
