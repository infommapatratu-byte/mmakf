-- Supabase Data API lockdown, for the table added by 0054.
--
-- 0010_data_api_lockdown.sql states the rule this file obeys:
--
--     "A future migration that adds tables must be followed by a NEW lockdown
--      migration — never by editing this one."
--
-- 0054 adds ONE table, `schedule_day_cache`, and it holds nothing private: a
-- club's opening hours are public and are already printed in HTML on
-- /facilities, /schedule, /dojos and every club page. It is secured regardless,
-- for the reason the loop below is written against the catalogue rather than a
-- list of names: a table left outside the lockdown is a table nobody notices
-- until the day it matters, and "this one is harmless" is exactly the judgement
-- that ages badly.
--
-- There is a second reason here specifically. The cache is DERIVED state. If it
-- were reachable through an open Data API it would be writable through one, and
-- a writable cache is a way to publish hours the federation never approved —
-- a club shown as open at a time no version of its schedule ever said. The
-- authority for a timetable is `schedule_versions`; this table must never
-- become a second one.
--
-- tests/data-api-lockdown.test.ts insists on this file by name: "has no
-- migration creating a table behind the lockdown".
